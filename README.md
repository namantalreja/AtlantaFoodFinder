# AtlantaFoodFinder

Atlanta Food Finder is a website that allows users to discover restaurants in the Atlanta area and provides them with the information to choose one to visit.

## Motivation

We wanted to help people in the Atlanta area choose restaurants more easily by proviiding a website for this area that shows cuisine type, location on Google Maps, and reviews - the users can also save restaurants to a favorites list to come back later, and can leave their own reviews for places they visit.

## Tech/Frameworks Used

We used Python in the Django framework as well as HTML for structure and design.

## API Reference

We used the Google Maps API.

## Installation

Install Python 3.9, Django 4.2.16, pillow 10.4.0, python-dotenv 1.0.1, requests 2.32.3
